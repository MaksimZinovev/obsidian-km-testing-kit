## Questions and Notes
The first and very important part of the test planning process is to gather information about the project, its goals, team's values, technical aspects, resources, processes, roles, etc. This requires involvement of the whole team. That is why most of the sections of the current version of the test plan contain questions and notes yet to be discussed (highlighted using block quotes). For example

> Why do we test, and what does quality mean?

This was made with the intention to allow coming back and using them as a starting point for discussion in the future. It can help us to iterate, adjust and improve the test plan when it is required.
